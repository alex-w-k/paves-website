# Denver Metro Bisexual Social Club!
---
We use bisexual as an umbrella term. This group is for any and all bisexuals, pansexuals, polysexuals, gender/sexual queers, bi-romantics, bi-curious, sexually fluid, ____(add your label or unlabel here), and allies in the Boulder, Longmont, and Denver areas who want to meet other monogamous and polyamorous bisexuals to socialize and build COMMUNITY. I capitalize community, because that's our number one goal!  Often bisexuals are discriminated in both straight and LGBT groups. It is our mission to create safe spaces for bisexuals to thrive and gain support in. All genders are welcome. We host many fun social events from coffee and conversation, game nights, hiking, family friendly events, to cidery, winery, or brewery tours, nights out dancing, and our monthly Queers & Quiche brunch.
