### Visibility
Even within the LGBTQ community bisexuals can be pretty invisible. PAVES is working to change that. For example, we created a bi+ float for Pride and marched together in the parade. We also craft together to make visibility bracelets, hats, and etc.

## Codi Coday
### President
#### Pronouns: She, Her, Hers
Codi has been bisexual since, well forever (duh) and realized so in Houston, TX at 18 where she is originally from. Codi moved to Denver in 2013 largely in part to escape the intolerance for all LGBTQ+ in the Bible belt and is happy to call Denver her new home. The hatred, abuse, and erasure she has experienced in the past, with an absence of support, just for being bisexual fueled her passion to start PAVES so that other bisexual people don’t have to go through what she did or worse. Codi studied Biology and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Denver and now speaks and writes about intersectional feminism, ethical nonmonogamy, sexuality, gender, jealousy, sex education, and living with a chronic illness. In her free time she organizes a large social polyamorous group in Denver, loves to camp, and attempts to paint. She also enjoys binging on television and movies, and spends a lot of time yelling at ridiculous depictions of love triangles and bisexuals who just “don’t want a label” (looking at you Piper Chapman). Feel free to connect with her below.

## Alex Koch
### Vice President
#### Pronouns: He, Him, His
Alex was born in Colorado Springs and has lived in various parts of Colorado most of his life. He was in the Navy for 5 years as an Electronics Technician (Radio) on submarines. There he learned how to not get attached to a place he lived and how to navigate bureaucracy somewhat well. He figured out he was bi when he started to read more on the Bi+ definitions. He began getting involved in Bi+ issues when he started dating people that were Bi+ and saw the hatred from the gay community at Denver pride aimed at Bi people. Alex is attending an intensive program for web development and hopefully can use the skills he will learn there to make better and more secure websites for Bi+ organizations. In his free time Alex loves to obsess over new technology things and spend way too much money trying to make his home a smart home, he also likes watching weird indie arthouse cinema and terrible movies. Feel free to contact him using the links below!

## Timmy EverLes
### Director of Community Outreach
#### Pronouns: She, Her, Hers
Timmy was raised in rural Missouri by her two moms and lived with her dad in Kansas City on weekends.  Due to the culturally insensitive climate at the K-12 country school that she attended, she was often bullied by her peers for having gay parents.  After working through this trauma and embracing her own bisexuality in adulthood, she has made it her mission in life to create as many safe spaces and support for others as possible, especially individuals targeted for being different.  She moved to Denver the summer of 2015 to escape the Midwest mindset and to find a master’s program in counseling.  Her days mostly consist of working way too many hours in the human services field and studying to become a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) at Regis University.  In her off-time she can be found co-organizing the Denver Metro Bisexuals’ Social Club on meetup.com, volunteering for local LGBT and human service groups, researching art therapy techniques, dreaming up anti-bullying campaigns, touring art museums and galleries, hiking, climbing rocks, baking gluten-free desserts, crocheting funtabulous hats, and snapchatting photos of her herd of cats.  Please, click the links below to contact her directly.

## Sean Friend
### Secretary
#### Pronouns: He, Him, His
In addition to his role as Board member, Sean Friend serves as the Secretary for PAVES.  He is 32 years old, and has been in his bisexual phase since 1984.  He’s moved around a lot since then, but spent most of his time in Colorado and most recently in the Denver Metro area.  He finished his MA in Postcolonial and Religious Studies at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver in 2013 and seems to spends most of his time arguing with people on the internet.  His other activities include spending time with his partner and two kids, listening to Propagandhi, and working to pay for his vegan cookie dough habit.  He got involved in PAVES because he’s passionate about creating safe spaces for transgender and bisexual youth.  He encourages you to reach out by the links down below so he can have another excuse to procrastinate getting work done.
