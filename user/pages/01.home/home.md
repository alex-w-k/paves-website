### Visibility
Even within the LGBTQ community bisexuals can be pretty invisible. PAVES is working to change that. For example, we created a bi+ float for Pride and marched together in the parade. We also craft together to make visibility bracelets, hats, and etc.

## Codi Coday
### President
#### Pronouns: She, Her, Hers
Codi has been bisexual since, well forever (duh) and realized so in Houston, TX at 18 where she is originally from. Codi moved to Denver in 2013 largely in part to escape the intolerance for all LGBTQ+ in the Bible belt and is happy to call Denver her new home. The hatred, abuse, and erasure she has experienced in the past, with an absence of support, just for being bisexual fueled her passion to start PAVES so that other bisexual people don’t have to go through what she did or worse. Codi studied Biology and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Denver and now speaks and writes about intersectional feminism, ethical nonmonogamy, sexuality, gender, jealousy, sex education, and living with a chronic illness. In her free time she organizes a large social polyamorous group in Denver, loves to camp, and attempts to paint. She also enjoys binging on television and movies, and spends a lot of time yelling at ridiculous depictions of love triangles and bisexuals who just “don’t want a label” (looking at you Piper Chapman). Feel free to connect with her below.

## Alex Koch
### Vice President
#### Pronouns: He, Him, His
Alex was born in Colorado Springs and has lived in various parts of Colorado most of his life. He was in the Navy for 5 years as an Electronics Technician (Radio) on submarines. There he learned how to not get attached to a place he lived and how to navigate bureaucracy somewhat well. He figured out he was bi when he started to read more on the Bi+ definitions. He began getting involved in Bi+ issues when he started dating people that were Bi+ and saw the hatred from the gay community at Denver pride aimed at Bi people. Alex is attending an intensive program for web development and hopefully can use the skills he will learn there to make better and more secure websites for Bi+ organizations. In his free time Alex loves to obsess over new technology things and spend way too much money trying to make his home a smart home, he also likes watching weird indie arthouse cinema and terrible movies. Feel free to contact him using the links below!

## Kayla Kent
### Legal
#### Pronouns: She, Her, Hers

Kayla is a Denver native and a recent graduate of the University of Denver law school, earning her legal license on Halloween of 2016. In school, Kayla represented Coloradan non-profits and public benefit corporations in a legal clinic and served on the Board of Directors for the OUTLaws, an organization for LGBTQ+ law students. While she had been an LGBTQ+ rights activist since middle school, OUTLaws was her first role as an ‘out’ bisexual. Kayla joined PAVES because she regrets that, even as an activist immersed in LGBTQ+ culture, bisexuality was so overlooked that it took her a quarter-century to come out, even to herself. She is passionate about programming that will allow and embrace young polysexuals and encourage their self-discovery. She also loves thinking and writing about live music, polyamory, video games, mental health, and dinosaurs (preferably at the same time??). Feel free to connect with her below!
