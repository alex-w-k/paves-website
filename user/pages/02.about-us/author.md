# About Us
#### Our History:
PAVES arose from a frustration in the status quo. As bisexuals, we often felt out of place in many LGBTQ+ events or even unwelcome, but Pridefest 2015 in Denver was the final straw. Even though bisexuals are the majority of LGBTQ+ we literally nothing related to bisexual pride or representation except the B in LGBT. When we asked vendors about bisexual representation we were cursed and yelled at. That is when we decided to make some changes. For Pridefest 2016 we held fundraisers to raise money to build a float. We worked hard and finally made ourselves finally visible! In the process we discovered there are plenty of passionate polysexuals/ bisexuals+ who want a community and to fight against biphobia and bi erasure. At the time we called ourselves Denver Bisexuals and Pansexuals. Coming together and figuring out we weren't alone as bisexuals improved our lives drastically and we want to do the same for others both in Denver and beyond.


#### Our Mission:
The mission of PAVES is to, through outreach and awareness campaigns, ensure that polysexual individuals know they are not forgotten and are never alone.
